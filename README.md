**Representation-Free Residue as an Operational Invariance Metric**

Most mathematics relies on specific encodings:

digit bases, coordinates, symbolic alphabets.

This repository explores an alternate operational direction:

**Truth(X) = what remains invariant across arbitrary recodings.**

Instead of fixing a single representation, we measure the structural residue
that survives transformation families.

## Core Principle

Given an object X, apply representation changes:

base shifts, permutations, reversals, encoding swaps,
compression-preserving recodings.

Then define:

Residue(X) = invariant part under these transformations  
Truth(X) = representation-free structural stability

---

## Minimal Operational Seed

This repo provides two executable toy estimators:

residue_score  
A simple consensus measure under basic recodings.

omega_score  
An Omega-like compression-stability residue:

high Ω  -> stable structure survives recoding  
low Ω   -> collapse toward noise / drift

Compression acts as a practical probe:

Structure = what remains compressible and invariant.

## Files

invariance.py  
Minimal invariance + residue estimators.

README.md  
Concept, usage, context.

## Quick Example

    from invariance import residue_score, omega_score

    x = "mathematical structure"

    print("Residue score:", residue_score(x))
    print("Omega score:", omega_score(x))

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal:
dependency-free, post-hoc, representation-agnostic.

It is meant as a standalone executable seed, not a full framework.

---

## Larger Context (OMNIA / MB-X.01)

This repository is a minimal standalone seed on representation-free invariance.

A larger structural measurement ecosystem (Ω-residue, saturation limits, stop certificates)
is developed in the main OMNIA project:
