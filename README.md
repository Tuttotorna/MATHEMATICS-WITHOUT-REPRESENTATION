# MATHEMATICS-WITHOUT-REPRESENTATION

A minimal research thread on **representation-free structural invariance**.

This repository explores a strict idea:

**Mathematical truth is what remains invariant under arbitrary recodings.**

Bases, digits, tokenizations, coordinates, and symbolic encodings are not fundamental.
They are anthropological interfaces.

The goal here is to study mathematics as:

- transformations
- invariants
- residual structure
- formal saturation / stop conditions

## Core Principle

Given an object `X`, apply a family of representation changes:

- base change
- permutation
- compression
- re-encoding
- re-tokenization

Then measure the invariant residue:

**Truth = Invariant(X) = what cannot be removed by recoding.**

## Why this exists

Most mathematics is still practiced through human encodings:

- positional notation
- coordinate frames
- fixed symbolic alphabets

This project treats representation as noise.

Only the invariant residue matters.

## Relation to OMNIA (MB-X.01)

This thread is conceptually aligned with:

- Ω (Omega-set): invariant residual estimation
- OMNIA-LIMIT: certified structural saturation (SNRC)

But this repository is intentionally **representation-first**, not ecosystem-first.

## Minimal Structure (planned)

- `invariance.py` : transformation family + residue estimator
- `examples/minimal_demo.py` : smallest executable invariant test

## Status

Frozen seed. First operational module next.
